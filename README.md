# Logo-Gen-SVG

## Description

In this assignment I was tasked with creating a command-line application that accepts user input to create a 300x200 pixel image. 

After running node index.js in their command-line, the user is prompted to answer questions about color and text options to create an SVG image. The user can choose the shape, sahape color, text, and text color. When the user successfully created the file the command line will notify them the SVG logo has been generated.
